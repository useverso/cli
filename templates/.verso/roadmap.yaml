# VERSO Roadmap
# https://useverso.dev
#
# Goal-based milestones, not time-based sprints.
# A milestone completes when ALL its criteria are met -- not when a date arrives.
#
# Instructions:
#   1. Set your vision (one sentence, your product's north star)
#   2. Define your first milestone under "milestones"
#   3. Set the "now" horizon to point at that milestone
#   4. Add criteria -- these become your definition of done
#   5. As you complete milestones, move them through the horizons

vision: ""  # Your product's north star in one sentence

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Three-Horizon Roadmap
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# NOW   - Current milestone, actively building
# NEXT  - Planned, requirements known but not yet refined
# LATER - Future ideas, captured but not committed to
horizons:
  now:
    milestone: mvp
    focus: ""  # What you are building right now (one sentence)
  next:
    milestone: polish
    focus: ""  # What comes after the current milestone
  later: []   # Future milestone names, e.g. [scaling, marketplace]

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Milestones
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Each milestone is a statement that becomes true when it is complete.
# The Pilot uses these to prioritize work and detect scope creep.
milestones:
  mvp:
    name: "MVP"
    goal: ""  # e.g. "A user can complete the core workflow end-to-end"
    criteria:
      - id: core-feature
        description: ""  # A specific, testable capability
        issues: []       # GitHub issue numbers that satisfy this criterion
    exit_criteria:
      - "Zero critical bugs"
      - "Core user flows tested"
      - "TypeScript compiles clean"

  polish:
    name: "Polish"
    goal: ""  # e.g. "The product feels professional and handles edge cases"
    depends_on: [mvp]
    criteria: []    # Define when you get here
    exit_criteria:
      - "Zero known bugs above low severity"
      - "Performance within acceptable thresholds"
