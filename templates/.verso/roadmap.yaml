# VERSO Roadmap
# https://useverso.dev
#
# Goal-based milestones, not time-based sprints.
# A milestone completes when ALL its criteria are met -- not when a date arrives.
#
# Instructions:
#   1. Set your vision (one sentence, your product's north star)
#   2. Define your first milestone under "milestones"
#   3. Set the "now" horizon to point at that milestone
#   4. Add criteria -- these become your definition of done
#   5. As you complete milestones, move them through the horizons
#
# Tracking Fields:
#   Milestones:
#     - status: planned | active | completed
#     - started_at: ISO timestamp, set when first item moves to Building
#     - completed_at: ISO timestamp, set when all criteria are met
#   Criteria:
#     - status: pending | in_progress | done

vision: ""  # Your product's north star in one sentence

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Three-Horizon Roadmap
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# NOW   - Current milestone, actively building
# NEXT  - Planned, requirements known but not yet refined
# LATER - Future ideas, captured but not committed to
horizons:
  now:
    milestone: mvp
    focus: ""  # What you are building right now (one sentence)
  next:
    milestone: polish
    focus: ""  # What comes after the current milestone
  later: []   # Future milestone names, e.g. [scaling, marketplace]

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Milestones
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Each milestone is a statement that becomes true when it is complete.
# The Pilot uses these to prioritize work and detect scope creep.
